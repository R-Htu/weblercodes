# Welcome to Webler

## A word from the Webler crew

Webler is a group of friends from all over the world that always had fun coding and learning together. The problem we faced was that we didn't like any of the learning platforms currently available at the time. And so one day we decided: "Let's build our own".

Here we are now, after months of hard work, proudly presenting to you the fruits of our labour: A learning platform, unique in its kind, that aims to serve coders of all types, even the intermediate and advanced coders out there.

The strength of this community is truly each of its members. Each of us make this place nicer and more interesting every day.

We hope that you will love this place as much as we do. Happy coding!
